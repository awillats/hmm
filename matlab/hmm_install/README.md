NOTE: this folder is experiment 
it is intended as a duplicate of source and header files which should be available elsewhere
to make it easier for `coder.cinclude()` to find them 

A more robust solution would be to get `coder.cinclude()` to see the users default install location, 
but this hasn't been ironed out yet
