To generate documentation (to be rendered as a website) run `doxygen Doxyfile_wiz` or use the doxywizard application and open `Doxyfile_wiz` as its starting configuration.

The rest of the files in this directory are automatically generated by Doxygen and SHOULD NOT be editted directly. 

It is important that Doxygen is configured to output html to this directory `/hmm/docs/` not its default of `hmm/docs/html` so GitHub pages can see and render the website.
